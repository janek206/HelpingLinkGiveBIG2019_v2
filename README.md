# HelpingLinkGiveBIG2019  
# Updated by Jane Kuramoto 4/20/2019
#
#HTML is GiveBig2019.html
#CSS is GiveBig2019CSS.CSS
#
#
#Remaining items to fix include:
#
#1. Horizontal Bar chart in the "How does GiveBIG work" tab.
#It works when it is not part of the tab content but the bars are not appearing when the chart is in the tab 
#container.
#
#2. I would like to blur out Emily Zink's last name in the TETinSeattle photo.
#
#3. Add a GiveBig2019 icon somewhere on the page
#
#4. Make Where does your donation go content block static (it currently changes depending on the content).
#
#5. Add the HelpingLink logo to the footer.
