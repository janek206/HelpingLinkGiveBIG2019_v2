            I started my first day at Helping Link back in July 2017. English has been my biggest hurdle thus far
            as I have just immigrated to the U.S. from Vietnam a few months before with my family. After hearing about
            Helping Link from a few family members, I decided it was time for me to learn English and hopefully be able
            to communicate to my extended family better, especially those who have grown up here. The best thing I like
            about the ESL classes here about Helping Link is that the lessons are interactive and everyone in class is
            very friendly and welcoming. I would like to continue attending class to gain better knowledge and improve
            my English fluency.

                        In King County, 20% of of residents are foreign-born. Of those residents, <strong>43% speak English 
                        less than ‘very well.’</strong> English language skills are crucial for refugees and immigrants: 
                        they are what allow children to succeed in school, and adults to find employment.
                        <p>
                            Our ESL program provides at least one native English speaker and one bilingual English 
                            and Vietnamese speaker with clients, placing an emphasis on conversation practice 
                            and social interaction. Topics vary as we tailor lessons to match the needs of our 
                            clients. Volunteer tutors serve as facilitators to help each client reach their 
                            particular goals.

                            Our iPad basics and photo/video classes are very hands on! Most ESL adults find a 
                            keyboard interface to be challenging since they are not familiar with the language
                            or the keyboard layout.  A touch navigation system introduces basic technology concepts
                            necessary to navigate the internet and use email or social media to stay connected with family.

                        I have been living in the U.S. for less than a year. Before coming to Helping Link, I was still
                        getting adjusted to this new life. Thankfully, my daughter referred over to Helping Link as she
                        herself also took an ESL class there a few years prior. It was at Helping Link where I met a lot
                        of very nice tutors who were not only helpful but also very relatable. Although, my English still
                        has some progress to go, I have been able to retain basic words and initiate a few conversations.
                        While I had studied English in Vietnam, a major accident left me with impaired memory. However,
                        through Helping Link’s classes and patience, I have been able to make more progress than I thought
                        I could have done. For that, I am very grateful for the opportunity Helping Link has given me and
                        allowing me to spend my time to learn a new language in this new life.

                            I first came to Helping Link about two years ago to learn English just like everyone else. I found that
                            grasping the language myself was too much for me to communicate fluently. During the quarter, I really
                            liked my teacher, Leilani, as she helped me a lot. I found that lessons involving topics such as transportation
                            and banking very valuable and applicable to my life here in U.S. I learned a lot of practical skills and words
                            that helped me become more independent and resourceful. Taking ESL at Helping Link has motivated me to learn more.
